Seizure detection using Oscillatory Neural Networks

This project implements seizure detection using pipeline preprocessing of FASTA data of a ECG signal followed by prediction through an Oscillatory Convolutional Neural network to detect seizures.

Oscillatory Convolutional Neural networks use wave-like spatial kernels to predict using signal input instead of using static kernels that leave out oscillatoion information during prediction
